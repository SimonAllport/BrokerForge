# Set one instance secret of a connection design (HLD D-34) in the dev host's store. Stopgap until plan 4's page.
# Usage: [BF_ENVIRONMENT=<environment id>] tools/dev/set-instance-secret.sh <Instance> <name> [<Key Vault secret name>]
#   e.g. tools/dev/set-instance-secret.sh WarehouseAPI apiKey inventory-api-key
# The value never leaves Azure and is never printed: the host's admin command runs inside the running host container
# (az containerapp exec), so it uses the host's own identity, table and Data Protection key ring, and it reads the
# value itself from the Key Vault reference. Only the reference is on the command line. The command refuses an
# instance and name that no connection design in that environment lists in its secretNames.
# Note: `--from` takes any kv: or env: reference, so whoever can exec into the host can copy any Key Vault secret or
# environment variable the host identity can read into an instance secret (and then have the host send it to a design's
# source). Exec rights on the host are therefore equivalent to reading its secrets; grant them only to people who may.
